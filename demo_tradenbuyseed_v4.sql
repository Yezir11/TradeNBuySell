The 5-inch profile offers a reasonably firm yet comfortable sleeping surface, which works well for most students who do not want an overly soft bed. It has never been exposed directly to water or rain, and I have always kept it covered with a fitted bedsheet to avoid direct stains on the mattress surface. There is no sagging in the middle, and the edges still hold shape when you sit at the side of the bed.\n\nThe mattress has the expected minor signs of use such as light impressions in the usual sleeping area, but there are no deep pits or damaged zones. It has been used in a smoke-free, pet-free room, and I periodically aired it near the window for freshness. This makes it a good option if you are moving into a new room and want to avoid buying an expensive brand-new mattress for a limited duration of study. It fits typical hostel cots and most off-campus single beds, and can be transported easily with a cover or bedsheet tied around it.',1806.00,0,1,1209.00,50.00,'2025-11-02 15:37:56','2025-11-03 15:37:56',1,'Furniture','2025-11-13 01:12:22','2025-11-13 01:12:22');

It comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, which is more than enough for common apps, a reasonable number of photos, reference PDFs and a few offline videos. The 6.5-inch display is comfortable for reading notes or watching lectures on the go, and the 50MP triple camera setup takes clear pictures in decent lighting, which is handy for scanning assignments or capturing notes from the whiteboard.\n\nThe 4500mAh battery easily lasts through a regular college day with mixed usage like browsing, attending calls and light media consumption, and has not shown any abnormal drainage. The display is still bright and sharp, and I have always used it with a case and screen guard, so the body is in fairly good cosmetic condition for a used phone.
