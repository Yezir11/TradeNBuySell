PASSWORD INFORMATION
================================================================================

⚠️  IMPORTANT: Passwords are hashed using BCrypt and CANNOT be retrieved!

The passwords stored in the database are hashed (one-way encryption), so the 
original passwords cannot be determined from the database.

CURRENT STATUS:
- All users have passwords set (password_hash is not NULL)
- Passwords are hashed using BCrypt algorithm
- Each password hash is unique (even for the same password)

TO USE THESE ACCOUNTS FOR TESTING:

Option 1: Reset all passwords to a known value
  1. Run: cd backend && mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.tradenbysell.util.PasswordHashGenerator" -Dexec.args="password123"
  2. Copy the generated hash
  3. Update scripts/reset-all-passwords.sql with the hash
  4. Run: mysql -uroot -proot tradenbysell < scripts/reset-all-passwords.sql
  5. All users will then have password: "password123"

Option 2: Register new test users
  - Use the registration endpoint to create new users with known passwords
  - Email must end with @pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in

Option 3: Use password reset functionality (if implemented)
  - Reset individual user passwords through the application

RECOMMENDED TEST PASSWORD: "password123"
